#### About
Kodibuntu is a Linux operating system based on the Lubuntu variant of the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution.  
It has been tailored specifically for running Kodi and comes preconfigured out of the box.

Kodibuntu has two modes of operation - *Standalone-mode* and *Desktop-mode*.  
In *Standalone-mode*, Kodibuntu acts like an appliance, making it easy to get Kodi up and running.  
In *Desktop-mode*, you get a traditional desktop with easy access to other software, such as a web browser  
while still having Kodi only a few clicks away.  

Kodibuntu gives you access to all the software available from the Ubuntu repositories
You can easily install other software on it in addition to Kodi.
