You must have at least 512 megabytes of RAM to use this Ubuntu installer.

You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 500 megabytes for a minimal server installation. You'll need
more disk space to install additional packages, depending on what you
wish to do with your new KODIbuntu system.

You should have a video adaptor capable of accelerated OpenGL to enjoy
the full power of KODI. 
Any recent NVIDIA/AMD/Intel cards should be powerful enough.

See the Installation Guide or the FAQ for more information; both
documents are available at the KODI web site, 0fhttp://www.kodi.tv/07

Thank you for choosing KODIbuntu!
